# GladiatorLosSARemake (MoP_5.5)
PvP Sound Alert addon for WoW MoP Classic

Set Up:
1. Make sure you deleted all another GladiatorLosSA addons version.
2. Place GladiatorLosSARemake folder to "World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns" path.
3. Make sure you didn't disable "Enable sounds" property in "Audio" settings

Customisation (add/edit new spells by yourself):
1. You need edit only one file "spelllist.lua". Read and learn file. (May be in future I make a video how to do this).
2. You need download 2 addons for WoW "BugGrabber" and "BugSack" for easy debug your job.
