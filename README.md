# GladiatorLosSARemake (MoP Classic 5.5)
PvP Sound Alert addon for WoW MoP Classic

Set Up:
1. Make sure you deleted all another GladiatorLosSA addons version.
2. Place GladiatorLosSARemake folder to "World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns" path.
3. Make sure you didn't disable "Enable sounds" property in "Audio" settings

Customisation (add/edit new spells by yourself):
1. You need edit only one file "spelllist.lua". Read and learn file. (Maybe in future I make a video how to do this).
2. You need download two addons for WoW "BugGrabber" and "BugSack" for easy debug your job.
3. Add new or replace old soundfile you need check next folders "Voice_enUS" and "Voice_enUS_Short"
